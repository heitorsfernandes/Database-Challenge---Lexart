# Database Challenge - Lexart

In this database challenge, I worked with the World database, which I downloaded from the [MySQL website](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/index-other.html). The goal of the challenge was to create a new table called "AverageLifeExpectancy," which would store average life expectancy values for different regions. The table has two columns: "LifeProm" to store average life expectancy values and "Region" to store the corresponding region names.

1. Imported the World database into PHPMYADMIN (or any other database management system).
2. Created the "AverageLifeExpectancy" table.
3. Linked the "AverageLifeExpectancy" table with its data using a pivot table based on relevant data from other tables.
4. Exported the database and uploaded it to a public GitHub repository.
